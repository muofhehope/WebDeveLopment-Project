 <h2>My top 5 movies of all times.</h2>

 <h3>Daddy's little girls</h3>
 <p>My favourite drama movies when a mechanic and his family are struggling to make ends meet with his ex-girlfriend and her drug dealing boyfriend. He struggles to get custody of his children.
 </p>


 <h3>Purple hurts</h3>
 <p>My favourite romance/musical movie. Spite of their many differences. A struggling singer-songwriter and Luke, a troubled Marine, agree to marry solely for military benefits.</p>


 <h3>The bad guys</h3>
 <p>A gang of notorious animal criminals pretends to seek being rehabilitated, only for their leader to realize that he genuinely wants to change his ways.</p>

 <h3>The pursuit of happyness</h3>
 <p>A struggling salesman takes custody of his son as he's poised to begin a life-changing professional career.</p>

 <h3>Ready or not</h3>
 <p> bride's wedding night takes a sinister turn when her eccentric new in-laws force her to take part in a terrifying game.</p>
